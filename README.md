# Exercises for Python Practcing and Learning


#### Tuples 

- Tuples01: # Create a program that has a fully populated tuple with a count in words from zero to twenty.

- Tuples02: # Working with tuplas
            # Create a program that generates five random numbers and place them in a tupla.
            # Show the created numbers and smallest and highest values
            
- Tuples03: # Develop a program that takes four input values and store it into a tuple.
            # Show if and how many times the value "9" shows up
            # Shows in what position is value "3", if any
            # Shows the even numbers

- Tuples04: # Create a little program thar has products and its prices stored in a tuple.
            # At the end, show a price listing, organizing the data in tabular form.
            
- Tuples05: # Create a program that has a multi-word tuple (don't use accents). After that, you must show, for each word, what its vowels are.


### Lists

- Lists01: # Write a program that reads 5 numeric values and stores them in a list. At the end, show which was
           # the highest and lowest value entered and their respective positions in the list.
           
- Lists02: # Create a program where the user can enter several numeric values and register them in a list.
           # If the number already exists in there, it will not be added.
           # At the end, all unique values entered will be displayed, in ascending order.
           
- Lists03: # create a programa that let user enter five numeric values and inset them into a list at the right position.

- Lists04: # A program that take various number inputs and organize them in a lista.
           # How many numbers were entered?
           # List in descending order
           # if number 5 was inserted or not
           
- Lists05: # Build a little program that can read various number inputs and organize them into a list. Then the program should creat two new separates list for even and odd numbers.

- Lists06: 

- Lists07: # Create a program where the user can type seven numeric values and register them in a single list that keeps even and odd values ​​separate.
           # At the end, show the even and odd values in ascending order.
           
- Lists08: # Create a program that declares a 3×3 dimensional matrix and fills it with values
           # read from the keyboard. At the end, show the matrix on the screen, with the correct formatting.
         
- Lists09: # Python Exercise 087: Improve the previous challenge by showing at the end:
           # A) The sum of all even value entered.
           # B) The sum of the values in the third column.
           # C) The largest value of the second row.
           
- Lists10: # Write a program that helps a LOTTO player to create guesses.
           # The program will ask how many games will be generated and will draw 6 numbers between 1 and
           # 60 for each game, registering everything in a composite list.
           
- Lists11: # Create a program that reads the name and two grades of several students and stores them all in a composite list.
           # At the end, show a report card containing the average of each one and allow the user to show the grades of each student individually.
